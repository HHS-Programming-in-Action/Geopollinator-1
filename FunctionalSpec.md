Geopollinator
=============

##The problem:
Geopolitics is a social studies course which requires students to
memorize/learn the countries in the world. The difficulty with this
is that most websites which offer a way to study countries, either do
not have all the countries for one test, and require a student to study
part of one test and part of another; or they are simply not specific
enough in the maps to cover all the countries covered by the class.

##Our Solution:
Create a website that uses a map and prompts the user, asking, "Where
is this country?" and a point-and-click method of finding those
countries. You will be able to choose which countries that you would
like to study. The user will be able to update the map at any time with ease.

##Our visual will be as follows:
The home screen will have a select list of commonly studied country
groups (Europe, Middle East etc.). On the top of the page is the main
opener [what is an "opener?"], it will have a country selection list, 
and the user will select which countries they wish to study. Based on
the farthest to the left, to the right, down, and up it will set the
area that the program zooms in on. If the country is smaller than a
certain size, and the user misses it, an arrow will point and the area
immediately around the country will glow. The user will have a zoom
option.
This is so that the user can select smaller countries if they are studying over a large area.
Areas studied can be saved as study groups which will be stored as cookies in the users browsers.

##To do list
1. Change the program to read SVG files.
2. Find a svg repository that is updated.
